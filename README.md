Light Paintings
==================

The goal of this project is to write a program that can take an image and output a spatial arrangement of colored-glass shapes that, when shined upon by a light source, produces a shadow that approximates the input image. For a visual, see this art piece by Rashad Alakbarov: http://rashadalakbarov.com/en/works/installations/2011/fly-to-baku/.
